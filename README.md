```
...
├── dist - the folder into which the site is going
└── src - folder with site sources
```

The path `/ src / html / views /` in the file `index.html` can be edited
information without digging into the code.

The main text is located at the path `/ src / html / includes /` in the file
`content.html` (edited only here, as `IS` needed to be moved to the second line).

After any changes, the project must be compiled.

#### Commands:

`yarn` - download all dependencies.

`yarn build` - build a project.

`yarn start` - start the project in development mode.
